1. **[01_hardware.md](../01_hardware.md)** - Hardware requirements and setup
2. **[02_installation.md](../02_installation.md)** - Installation and first boot
3. **[03_configuration.md](../03_configuration.md)** - Configuration via web UI
4. **[04_features.md](../04_features.md)** - Features and usage guide
5. **[05_ota_updates.md](../05_ota_updates.md)** - OTA update procedures
6. **[06_troubleshooting.md](../06_troubleshooting.md)** - Troubleshooting and diagnostics

Developer documentation has been moved to [docs/developer/](../developer/).
